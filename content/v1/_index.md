### Introduction

This workshop offers a practical tutorial on large language models (LLMs) and their applications, focusing on open-source LLMs. Participants will learn key concepts such as model parameters, quantization, context, and tokens. The course emphasizes using lightweight pre-trained models, enabling efficient deployment even on devices with limited computing resources.

We will utilize **Ollama**, a tool for running LLMs locally without complex configurations. The course includes setting up **ChatBox**, a user-friendly GUI interface for interacting with LLMs via Ollama. We will work with Meta's **Llama** 3.2 models.

By the end of this course, participants will have hands-on experience in running and interacting with open-source LLMs locally.
