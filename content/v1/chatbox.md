**Using ChatBox as a GUI Interface for Ollama**

We are going to use a GUI interface for Ollama called [**ChatBox**](https://chatboxai.app/en). ChatBox provides a simple and easy-to-run interface without requiring Docker or any complex configurations. It works across almost all platforms, including mobile devices, Android, iOS, and desktop operating systems.

#### **About ChatBox**

- **Editions Available:**
  - **Community Edition (Open Source):** Fully open-source version.
  - **Regular Edition (Closed Source):** Proprietary version with additional features not necessary for running local LLMs.

- Both editions are mostly the same in terms of functionality for our purposes. If you prefer a fully open-source option, it's recommended to go with the Community Edition.

#### **Download Links**

- **Community Edition (Open Source):**
  - Download from GitHub Releases: [ChatBox Community Edition](https://github.com/Bin-Huang/chatbox/releases)

- **Regular Edition (Closed Source):**
  - Download from the official website: [ChatBox AI](https://chatboxai.app/en#download)

#### **Next Steps**

We will now download and install ChatBox on your operating system. After installation, we will connect ChatBox to our LLM running through Ollama.
